Hi! I'm Markus, an ICT enthusiast from Turku, Finland, with interest in web, computers as well as photography and nature.

## Projects and things

### Potato Timer

A simple Pomodoro-style timer with intuitive CLI, written in Python. Developed and tested in Pop!\_OS Linux and occasionally tested in Windows 10. [More information on GitHub](https://github.com/mtijas/potato-timer)

### Löpökulu

A work-in-progress project to create a Django web application for vehicle fuel usage monitoring. The project was started as a school project during autumn 2021 semester at TUAS, and work slowly continues afterwards.

Code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/mtijas/lopokulu/tree/development) with [some wiki items as well](https://github.com/mtijas/lopokulu/wiki).

### Föli CLI

A simple CLI application to see bus timetables and follow buses in real time in Turku area. Still very much work in progress. The target of this project is to learn more on Python, unit testing, different software architectures and multiprocessing.

Available once again [on GitHub](https://github.com/mtijas/foli-cli/tree/dev).
